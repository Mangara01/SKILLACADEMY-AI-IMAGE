# Animal Classification

## Key Feature

* Data Preprocessing and Augmentation: The code includes data preprocessing steps such as resizing, random rotation, random horizontal flip, and random cropping of the input images.
* Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: The architecture includes convolutional layers, batch normalization, ReLU activation, max-pooling, and fully connected layers.
* GPU Acceleration: The code checks for the availability of a GPU (CUDA) and transfers the model and data to the GPU if one is present.
